Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a service to make passing the driving test for your license easier with practice tests and live teaching. The client is DriverPass. They want a web hosted site that can be used across multiple browsers.
What did you do particularly well?
Determining system requirements.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Most of my system design docements with the UML. UML was particularilry hard for me to digitize the diagrams, I would practice more with lucid chart and pay for the premium to have access to more document space and shapes.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by envisioning myself in there shoes and how I would want the system to act within the clients wishes. It's important because if it's too clunky or difficult to use or navigate people will be less likely to use it again.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like to apporach software desgin from the user's stand point and a test centric methodology. It leads to better code that works and code that's easier to improve and implement.
